I am a student at Mathematical Science Department, Universiti Brunei
Darussalam. I live (permanently) in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara,
Indonesia and being (temporarily) in Brunei. Currently I work on my
recent research project related to spatial modelling for Gaussian data
with Bayesian hierarchical model as well as conditional auto-regressive
(CAR) model to explain the spatial structure in the neighborhood area. I
also learn R to support my project.
