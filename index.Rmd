# About Me

I am a student at Mathematical Science Department, [Universiti Brunei Darussalam](https://ubd.edu.bn/). I live (permanently) in Mataram, West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia and being (temporarily) in Brunei. 
Currently I work on my recent research project related to spatial modelling for Gaussian data with Bayesian hierarchical model as well as conditional auto-regressive (CAR) model to explain the spatial structure in the neighborhood area. I also learn R to support my project.
